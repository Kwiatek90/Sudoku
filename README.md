## Introduction

This project is an implementation of the Sudoku game in Python, with two main functionalities:

* Sudoku Board Generation:
    * The program generates a Sudoku board by filling it with random numbers from 1 to 9, following the Sudoku rules, i.e., ensuring that numbers in each of the nine 3x3 squares.
* Sudoku Solving:
    * Players can check if the Sudoku board they provide is a valid solution according to the Sudoku rules.

## Setup

You only need the appropriate version of python and its libraries,  running in your IDLE environment (I recommend Visual studio code or PyCharm)
